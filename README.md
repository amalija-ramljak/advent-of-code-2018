### _Solutions in Python_

Runnable:

    x.py - the runnable file that takes in the input

Inputs:

    inputx.txt - the file with my input for that day
    
    inputx-manual.txt - if the day has this one instead of the above format, the data has to be entered manually
    
    - if an input file is missing, it means my input data is saved into the runnable file already
    
    xy.txt - examples given for that day, mostly in order



Other:

    name.py, helpersx.py - helper files for the day (functions, classes)
